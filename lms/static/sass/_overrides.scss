/* Most CSS styling in Open edX is done with Sass files compiled to CSS. You can override individual settings by creating a new Sass file that uses the existing file, and overrides the few settings you want.

For example, to change the fonts used throughout the site, you can create an lms/static/sass/_overrides.scss file with the change you want:

$sans-serif: 'Helvetica';

The variables that can currently be overridden are defined in lms/static/sass/base/_variables.scss. */
